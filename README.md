# REST Adapter for FAS

The [.NET Custom Adapter SDK](https://github.com/FileAnalysisSuite/AdapterSdk) enables third parties to integrate with FAS.

This REST Adapter is a service which implements the Custom Adapter interfaces by calling out to a well-defined REST contract.

The REST Adapter contract is defined in the [`adapter-rest-contract`](https://github.com/FileAnalysisSuite/adapter-rest-contract) repository.

The REST contract can be implemented in any programming language, essentially allowing custom adapters to be developed in any language.
